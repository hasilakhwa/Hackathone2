## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Natural Language Todo Creation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

As a logged-in user, I want to create todos using natural language commands so that I can quickly add tasks without filling forms.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of an AI chatbot - converting natural language to structured actions. Without this, there's no chatbot functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing "add task to buy groceries", verifying AI calls POST /api/todos with title "buy groceries", and todo appears in list. Delivers natural language task creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user types "add buy groceries", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI calls POST /api/todos with title "buy groceries" and confirms "Added: buy groceries"
2. **Given** a logged-in user types "create a task to review pull requests", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI extracts "review pull requests" as title and creates todo
3. **Given** a logged-in user types "remind me to call mom", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI creates todo with title "call mom"
4. **Given** a logged-in user types "add" (incomplete command), **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "What would you like to add?" (clarification request)
5. **Given** a logged-in user types random text with no intent, **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "I can help you manage todos. Try 'add [task]' or 'list todos'"

---

### User Story 2 - Natural Language Todo Listing (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want to view my todos using natural language so that I can check my tasks conversationally.

**Why this priority**: After creation, listing is the most common operation. Users need to see what tasks they have.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing "show my todos" or "list tasks", verifying AI calls GET /api/todos, and displays results in readable format. Delivers conversational task viewing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user types "list my todos", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI calls GET /api/todos and displays all todos with status
2. **Given** a logged-in user types "show me my tasks", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI lists all todos in readable format
3. **Given** a logged-in user types "what do I need to do?", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI lists pending todos only
4. **Given** a logged-in user has no todos and types "list todos", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "You have no todos. Would you like to create one?"
5. **Given** a logged-in user types "show pending" or "show completed", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI filters and displays todos by status

---

### User Story 3 - Natural Language Todo Completion (Priority: P3)

As a logged-in user, I want to mark todos as completed using natural language so that I can update task status conversationally.

**Why this priority**: Completing tasks is a frequent operation. Natural language makes it faster than clicking buttons.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing "complete buy groceries", verifying AI finds todo by title, calls PATCH /api/todos/{id}/complete, and confirms completion. Delivers conversational status updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user has a pending todo "buy groceries" and types "complete buy groceries", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI finds todo by title match, calls complete endpoint, and confirms "Marked 'buy groceries' as completed"
2. **Given** a logged-in user types "mark task 5 as done", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI calls PATCH /api/todos/5/complete
3. **Given** a logged-in user types "finish the code review task", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI searches for todo with title containing "code review" and completes it
4. **Given** multiple todos match the user's description, **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "Multiple todos match. Please be more specific: [list matches]"
5. **Given** no todos match the user's description, **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "No todo found matching '[description]'"

---

### User Story 4 - Natural Language Todo Update (Priority: P4)

As a logged-in user, I want to update todo titles using natural language so that I can refine tasks conversationally.

**Why this priority**: Editing is less frequent than creating or completing, making this lower priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing "change 'buy milk' to 'buy almond milk'", verifying AI finds todo, calls PATCH /api/todos/{id} with new title, and confirms update. Delivers conversational task editing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user has todo "buy milk" and types "update buy milk to buy almond milk", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI finds todo by title, calls update endpoint with new title, and confirms "Updated: buy milk → buy almond milk"
2. **Given** a logged-in user types "rename task 3 to review security audit", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI calls PATCH /api/todos/3 with title "review security audit"
3. **Given** a logged-in user types "change the groceries task to buy organic groceries", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI finds todo with "groceries" in title and updates it
4. **Given** the user's command is ambiguous (multiple matches), **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI asks "Which todo? [list matches]"

---

### User Story 5 - Natural Language Todo Deletion (Priority: P5)

As a logged-in user, I want to delete todos using natural language so that I can remove tasks conversationally.

**Why this priority**: Deletion is the least frequent operation, making this lowest priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing "delete buy groceries", verifying AI finds todo, calls DELETE /api/todos/{id}, and confirms deletion. Delivers conversational task removal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user has todo "buy groceries" and types "delete buy groceries", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI finds todo by title, calls DELETE endpoint, and confirms "Deleted: buy groceries"
2. **Given** a logged-in user types "remove task 7", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI calls DELETE /api/todos/7
3. **Given** a logged-in user types "get rid of the completed tasks", **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "This would delete [N] todos. Confirm? (yes/no)" (safety check for bulk operations)
4. **Given** no todo matches the deletion request, **When** AI processes the command, **Then** AI responds "No todo found to delete"

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user types ambiguous command like "fix the bug"? **AI responds "I don't understand. Would you like to add a todo 'fix the bug'?"**
- What happens when user asks non-todo questions like "what's the weather"? **AI responds "I can only help with todo management. Try 'add [task]', 'list todos', etc."**
- What happens when AI cannot extract a valid intent? **AI responds with helpful examples of supported commands**
- What happens when user tries to complete/update/delete another user's todo via natural language? **AI uses same JWT authentication; backend returns 403; AI reports "Todo not found or not accessible"**
- What happens when user types command with typos like "ad buy milk"? **AI interprets "ad" as "add" (fuzzy matching) and creates todo**
- What happens when JWT token expires during chat? **AI receives 401 from backend, prompts user to login again**
- What happens when backend is down? **AI receives connection error, responds "Unable to connect to todo service. Please try again."**
- What happens when user types very long command (1000+ chars)? **AI processes normally; only extracts relevant task title (max 500 chars per domain rule)**

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### AI Chatbot Interface
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a chat interface in frontend (text input + message history)
- **FR-002**: System MUST send user messages to AI agent for intent recognition
- **FR-003**: AI agent MUST classify user intent into one of: CREATE, LIST, COMPLETE, UPDATE, DELETE, CLARIFY, UNKNOWN
- **FR-004**: AI agent MUST extract relevant parameters from natural language (e.g., todo title, todo ID, filter criteria)
- **FR-005**: AI agent MUST handle ambiguous commands by requesting clarification
- **FR-006**: AI agent MUST provide helpful suggestions when intent is unclear
- **FR-007**: Chat interface MUST display both user messages and AI responses in conversation format

#### MCP Tool Integration
- **FR-008**: AI agent MUST use MCP tools to call backend REST APIs (not direct HTTP calls)
- **FR-009**: AI agent MUST include JWT token from user session when calling todo APIs
- **FR-010**: AI agent MUST use POST /api/todos MCP tool for CREATE intent
- **FR-011**: AI agent MUST use GET /api/todos MCP tool for LIST intent
- **FR-012**: AI agent MUST use PATCH /api/todos/{id}/complete MCP tool for COMPLETE intent
- **FR-013**: AI agent MUST use PATCH /api/todos/{id} MCP tool for UPDATE intent
- **FR-014**: AI agent MUST use DELETE /api/todos/{id} MCP tool for DELETE intent
- **FR-015**: MCP tools MUST pass JWT token in Authorization header (maintain authentication)

#### Intent Recognition & Safety
- **FR-016**: AI MUST NOT hallucinate todo IDs or titles (only use data from backend responses)
- **FR-017**: AI MUST NOT perform actions without user confirmation for bulk operations (e.g., "delete all completed")
- **FR-018**: AI MUST handle fuzzy matching for todo titles (e.g., "buy milk" matches "Buy milk from store")
- **FR-019**: AI MUST request clarification when multiple todos match user's description
- **FR-020**: AI MUST validate extracted parameters before calling MCP tools (e.g., non-empty title)
- **FR-021**: AI MUST handle backend errors gracefully and explain them to user (401 → "Please login", 403 → "Todo not found", 404 → "Todo doesn't exist")

#### Stateless & Database Integrity
- **FR-022**: AI agent MUST NOT store conversation history in server memory (stateless per Principle V)
- **FR-023**: AI agent MUST fetch fresh data from database via MCP tools for every query (no caching)
- **FR-024**: AI responses MUST be based on current database state only
- **FR-025**: All todo data MUST remain in database (no AI-side storage)

#### Frontend Integration
- **FR-026**: Frontend MUST add a chat panel or page (/chat) for AI interaction
- **FR-027**: Chat interface MUST send user messages to AI agent endpoint
- **FR-028**: Chat interface MUST display AI responses with proper formatting
- **FR-029**: Chat interface MUST maintain JWT authentication (same as existing pages)
- **FR-030**: Chat interface MUST provide example commands to guide users

### Key Entities

#### ChatMessage (frontend only, not persisted)
- **role** (string): "user" or "assistant"
- **content** (string): Message text
- **timestamp** (datetime): When message was sent

#### AIIntent (AI agent internal, not persisted)
- **intent** (enum): CREATE, LIST, COMPLETE, UPDATE, DELETE, CLARIFY, UNKNOWN
- **parameters** (object): Extracted data (title, id, filter, etc.)
- **confidence** (float): 0.0-1.0, request clarification if < 0.7

### Domain Rules (Constitution Principle IV)

**Phase 1 & 2 Rules MUST Be Maintained**:
- Todo status transitions: pending → completed (no reverse)
- Todo title validation: non-empty, max 500 chars
- User data isolation: user_id filtering via JWT
- Ownership checks: 403 if not owner
- All existing domain rules preserved

**AI Agent Rules** (NEW for Phase 3):
- AI MUST NOT create, modify, or delete todos without user intent
- AI MUST NOT access database directly (only via MCP tools calling backend APIs)
- AI MUST NOT store conversation history in database or memory
- AI MUST validate all extracted parameters before MCP tool invocation
- AI MUST handle ambiguity with clarification requests (never guess)
- AI MUST respect backend error responses (401, 403, 404) and explain to user
- AI MUST use fuzzy matching for title searches (case-insensitive, partial matches)

**MCP Tool Constraint Rules** (Principle VI enforced):
- AI MUST ONLY interact with backend through MCP tools
- MCP tools MUST wrap existing REST API endpoints (no new backend code)
- Each MCP tool MUST pass JWT token for authentication
- MCP tools MUST NOT bypass backend validation or authorization
- No direct database queries from AI (only via backend APIs)

**Intent Classification Rules**:
- CREATE: Keywords like "add", "create", "new", "remind me", "need to"
- LIST: Keywords like "list", "show", "what", "display", "my todos"
- COMPLETE: Keywords like "complete", "finish", "done", "mark as done"
- UPDATE: Keywords like "update", "change", "rename", "edit"
- DELETE: Keywords like "delete", "remove", "get rid of"
- CLARIFY: Ambiguous commands with multiple interpretations
- UNKNOWN: Commands outside todo management scope

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: User can type "add buy groceries" and todo is created via AI agent
- **SC-002**: User can type "list my todos" and AI displays current todos from database
- **SC-003**: User can type "complete buy groceries" and AI marks the todo as completed
- **SC-004**: User can type "update buy milk to buy almond milk" and AI updates the title
- **SC-005**: User can type "delete the groceries task" and AI removes the todo
- **SC-006**: AI correctly identifies ambiguous commands and requests clarification (accuracy > 90%)
- **SC-007**: AI never creates hallucinated todos (all todos created are from user commands only)
- **SC-008**: AI respects authentication - cannot access other users' todos via natural language
- **SC-009**: AI handles backend errors gracefully (401, 403, 404) with user-friendly explanations
- **SC-010**: Chat interface runs without errors and integrates with existing Phase 2 UI

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **MUST** use MCP tools to call Phase 2 backend APIs
- **MUST** maintain existing FastAPI backend without modifications
- **MUST** use LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT) for intent recognition
- **MUST** implement MCP server for todo API tool definitions
- **MUST** keep frontend changes minimal (add chat component/page only)
- **MUST** maintain JWT authentication for all operations
- **MUST NOT** store conversation history in database or server memory
- **MUST NOT** train or fine-tune models

### Constitution Compliance
- **Principle I (Spec-First)**: This spec MUST be complete and approved before planning begins
- **Principle II (Phase Discipline)**: Specification → Planning → Tasks → Implementation → Validation
- **Principle III (Exit Criteria)**: All acceptance scenarios MUST be testable
- **Principle IV (Domain Consistency)**: Phase 1 & 2 todo rules MUST be maintained; no changes to existing domain model
- **Principle V (Stateless Services)**: AI agent MUST be stateless; no conversation memory on server; database as only source of truth
- **Principle VI (MCP Tools)**: AI agent MUST use MCP tools exclusively for backend communication (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Principle VII (Cloud-Native)**: Phase 3 focuses on AI integration; Docker/Kubernetes deferred to future phases
- **Principle VIII (Process Over Features)**: Simple intent recognition; no advanced NLP; no multi-turn conversations
- **Principle IX (Folder Organization)**: All Phase 3 files MUST reside in `phase-3/` directory

### Safety & Determinism Constraints
- **No Hallucinations**: AI cannot invent todo IDs, titles, or user data
- **No Unauthorized Actions**: AI cannot bypass authentication or ownership checks
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same natural language input → same MCP tool call
- **Safe Defaults**: Unclear commands result in clarification, not guessed actions
- **Backend as Authority**: AI trusts backend responses (404 = not found, 403 = not authorized)

## Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

### Explicitly Excluded from Phase 3
- **No Model Training**: No fine-tuning, no custom model training
- **No Conversation Memory**: No chat history persistence (stateless per Principle V)
- **No Multi-Turn Context**: Each command treated independently (no "remember what I said earlier")
- **No Deployment**: No Docker, no Kubernetes (Phase 3 is local development)
- **No Event Streaming**: No Kafka, no Dapr (not needed for Phase 3 scope)
- **No Advanced NLP**: No sentiment analysis, no entity extraction beyond todo parameters
- **No Voice Interface**: Text-only chatbot
- **No Backend Changes**: Existing REST APIs remain unchanged
- **No Database Schema Changes**: No new tables or columns
- **No Frontend Redesign**: Minimal UI changes (add chat panel only)
- **No Proactive Suggestions**: AI responds only to user commands (no "you should do X")
- **No Todo Prioritization**: AI doesn't rank or suggest which todos to do first
- **No Natural Language Queries**: No complex queries like "show todos from last week" (simple list/filter only)

### Future Phases (Not Phase 3)
- **Phase 4 (potential)**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment
- **Phase 5 (potential)**: Advanced NLP features, multi-turn conversations, proactive suggestions

- All tools MUST NOT cache responses (fetch fresh data every time)

## Technology Updates (Gap Fixes)

### Official MCP SDK (GAP 6)
- **MCP Framework**: Migrated from `fastmcp` to **Official MCP SDK** (`mcp>=1.0.0`)
- Server uses `from mcp.server import Server` for tool definitions
- Tool schemas follow official MCP Tool type with inputSchema
- Flask HTTP wrapper maintained for frontend/ChatKit API compatibility

### OpenAI Agents SDK (GAP 3)
- **AI Framework**: Upgraded from custom function calling to **OpenAI Agents SDK** pattern (`openai-agents>=0.1.0`)
- Agent pattern: system prompt + tools + multi-turn tool dispatch
- Tool results fed back to LLM for natural language response generation
- Uses OpenRouter as provider via `openai` SDK with custom `base_url`

### OpenAI ChatKit UI (GAP 4)
- **Frontend Chat**: ChatPanel refactored to **ChatKit-compatible API pattern**
- Props interface: `endpoint`, `headers`, `initialMessages` for ChatKit compatibility
- Production ChatKit requires OpenAI domain key; dev uses compatible custom UI
- Conversation persistence via `conversation_id` parameter

### Conversation & Message DB Models (GAP 5)
- **Chat Persistence**: Added `Conversation` and `Message` SQLModel tables
- Conversations track user_id, title (auto-set from first message), timestamps
- Messages store role (user/assistant/system), content, and conversation_id
- New chat router at `/api/chat/` with conversation CRUD endpoints
